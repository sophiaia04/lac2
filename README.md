Face and Body Movement Detection API
Overview
This project integrates Face Detection and Body Movement Detection using advanced machine learning models, including YOLO (You Only Look Once). The Face API provides facial recognition and analysis, while the YOLO model detects and tracks body movements in real-time. The system can be used for applications in security, monitoring, fitness tracking, and more.

Features
Face Detection: Detects faces in images with bounding boxes and provides face attributes (e.g., age, gender, emotion).
Body Movement Detection: Uses YOLO to detect body poses and movement in real-time.
Face and Body Tracking: Combines face and body tracking to monitor individuals in dynamic environments.
Emotion Detection: Analyzes the emotional state of individuals through facial expressions.
Real-Time Processing: Supports real-time body and face detection through video streams.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
Libraries: dlib, face_recognition, YOLO (Darknet), numpy, cv2
Pretrained Models: YOLOv4 for body movement detection, pre-trained face recognition models
Version Control: Git/GitHub

Usage
The Face and Body Movement Detection API can be used in a standalone application or integrated into a broader system.

1. Face Detection Example
python
Copy code
import face_recognition
import cv2

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread("path_to_image.jpg")

# Convert the image to RGB
rgb_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Detect faces in the image
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(rgb_image)

# Draw rectangles around the faces
for (top, right, bottom, left) in face_locations:
    cv2.rectangle(image, (left, top), (right, bottom), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Show the resulting image
cv2.imshow("Face Detection", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
2. Body Movement Detection with YOLO
python
Copy code
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load YOLO
net = cv2.dnn.readNet("yolov4.weights", "yolov4.cfg")
layer_names = net.getLayerNames()
output_layers = [layer_names[i[0] - 1] for i in net.getOutputsNames()]

# Load input video or camera stream
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Change to file path for video

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Get image height and width
    height, width, channels = frame.shape

    # Prepare the image for YOLO
    blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 0.00392, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), True, crop=False)
    net.setInput(blob)
    outs = net.forward(output_layers)

    # Process YOLO's output to draw bounding boxes for detected bodies
    for out in outs:
        for detection in out:
            scores = detection[5:]
            class_id = np.argmax(scores)
            confidence = scores[class_id]
            if confidence > 0.5:  # Adjust this threshold as needed
                # Get the bounding box for the detected object
                center_x = int(detection[0] * width)
                center_y = int(detection[1] * height)
                w = int(detection[2] * width)
                h = int(detection[3] * height)

                # Draw bounding box
                cv2.rectangle(frame, (center_x - w // 2, center_y - h // 2), (center_x + w // 2, center_y + h // 2), (0, 255, 0), 2)

    # Display the resulting frame
    cv2.imshow("Body Movement Detection", frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
API Endpoints
